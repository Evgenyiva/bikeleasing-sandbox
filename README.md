# Bike Trip Analyzer

Hi there! 👋

We're pleased to have you here. 
This repository is designed to help you showcase your skills in a live pair-programming interview for a software engineer position.

We thought to keep the setup simple and straightforward, so you can focus on the coding challenge without getting bogged down in setup details.
At the core of the challenge is a [dataset of bike trips](src/main/kotlin/com/bikeleasing/biketrip/datastore/trips.csv), which you will be working with during the interview.

## Challenge Overview

The main tasks include:

1. Parsing the CSV file into an appropriate data structure
2. Calculating trip durations
3. Finding the youngest user and the average age
4. Calculating average trip duration
5. Whatever you might think is relevant, fun, interesting, or useful :)

## Repository Structure

This repository is set up with a minimal structure to allow candidates to quickly get started. You'll find:

- A Docker environment and basic Kotlin repo
- The `trips.csv` dataset in the data directory

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git
- Your preferred IDE (IntelliJ IDEA for Kotlin, PhpStorm/VSCode for PHP)

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository
2. Begin implementing the solution in your IDE (you can run the project either locally or inside Docker)
